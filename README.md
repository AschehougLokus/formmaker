* **Form name (required)** - this name will be used for identifying a from on a list.
* **First page label** (required) - a label which will be displayed on a first page. If you want to have a more than one page, you will define the labels in page separator.
* **Form CSS class** - just a CSS class that will be added into <form /> tag.
* **I want a confirmation page with the following label** (checkbox and text field) - if checked, confirmation page will be displayed as a last step of a form. More informations can be found under Setting confirmation page.
* **Receipt page label** (required) - receipt page is always displayed (as a last form step), so it needs a header, which needs to be defined here.
* **Receipt page intro text** - here you can place the plain text that will display under the receipt header.
* **Receipt page body text** - here you can place the plain text that will display under the receipt intro text (different styled).
* **Send data via email** (checkbox) - this option is checked by default (but of course you can disable it whenever you want). Means that all form input will be sent to recipients.
* **E-mail title** - the subject of e-mail message
* **E-mail recipients** - addresses separated by semicolons
* **Store data in database** (checkbox) - when checked, all form input will be stored in database. Then editor can use "See answers" option to list stored data (5. Viewing answers).
* **Use process class method** and **Process class name** - third way of processing input data. Developer can define here the PHP class name which will be executed when form is send.
