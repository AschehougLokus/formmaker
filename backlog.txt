BACKLOG:

forms editing
- copy an attribute
- each attribute should have a checkbox "Send by email", because not all attributes should be sent every time

forms list
- can't remove if assigned to any node - pls remove nodes first
- copy feature (opens edit view with all fields filled as in original)
		
general:
- nice css styling, look and feel improvements
- add Polish translations :)
- we should display somewhere which nodes are using the form

IDEAS:
- possibility to store data in db
- handling file uploads
- folders in list view to organize forms ( at least one level, then 'move', 'paste' features needed )

- POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
- add more than one mwezforms to one class. There should be no such possibility (at least for now).
